## Key Features  

1. **Wearable Device:**  
   - Monitors vital signs (e.g., heart rate, temperature).  
   - Equipped with GPS tracking for real-time location updates.  

2. **RC Rescue Car:**  
   - Deployed in emergencies to provide assistance or transport supplies.  
   - Integrated GPS and LoRa communication for navigation and status updates.  

3. **Long-Distance Connectivity:**  
   - Utilizes LoRa communication technology for stable, long-range data transmission.  

4. **Emergency Response:**  
   - Sends alerts in case of abnormalities in vital signs.  
   - Allows for real-time tracking and medical evacuation if needed.

## Hardware Components  

1. **Wearable Device:**  
   - ESP32  
   - Heart Rate Sensor (e.g., MAX30102)  
   - Temperature Sensor (e.g., DHT11 or DS18B20)  
   - GPS Module (e.g., NEO-6M)  
   - LoRa Module  

2. **RC Rescue Car:**  
   - ESP32  
   - Motor Driver (e.g., L298N)  
   - GPS Module  
   - LoRa Module  
   - Compass Sensor

## Software Components  

1. **Node-RED**  
   - Handles data visualization and processing.  
   - Provides a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring and control.  

2. **Embedded Programming:**  
   - Code written in Arduino IDE for ESP32 microcontrollers.  

3. **Communication Protocol:**  
   - LoRa for long-distance communication between the wearable device and RC car.  

4. **Backend:**  
   - MQTT broker for real-time data transmission.  

---

## How It Works  

1. **Monitoring:**  
   - The wearable device tracks health metrics and location in real-time.  

2. **Alert Trigger:**  
   - If abnormal metrics are detected, the system sends an alert to the control dashboard.  

3. **Rescue Deployment:**  
   - The RC car is deployed and navigates using GPS and compass data to reach the individual in need.  

4. **Continuous Updates:**  
   - Data is relayed back to the dashboard for tracking and coordination.
